# vsh
A library for vector spherical harmonics (VSH) tools

For details about the VSH, please look at [Mignard and Klioner, A&A 547, A59(2012)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2012A&A...547A..59M/doi:10.1051/0004-6361/201219927).

At present stage, these codes are just some separated ones.
These code might be merged into a Python module, which depends mainly on how much free time I have. 

For any questions, please contact me at [niu.liu@obspm.fr](niu.liu@obspm.fr).
